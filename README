Background
===

Originally from,

http://lmtserver.astro.umass.edu/svn/dreampy/trunk/dreampy/holography/src/punwrap/

which is supposed to be a wrapped version of

http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/GERI/90207.htm (dead link as of 2018/July/18)

Installation
===

The Makefile should work for Mac OS and Linux, but only for Python 2k.


Usage
===

The directory contains the `__init__.py` file which means you simply need the
directory in your path (PYTHONPATH) and then you `import punwrap`.

The `test.py` code will check that all is well and gives some guidance, but it
is straightforward to use as there is just one function.
